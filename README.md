# Scenario

Gerlad, our favorite contractor, has asked for a new application; it's very similar to other applications that he has had written.

# Gerald's Needs

  Gerald would like an application that gives him his entire list of supplies needed to build a house. He has a specific list of supplies that he's resposible for purchasing.
  
  - Gerald must purchase:
    - 2x4's (for studs and plates)
    - 4x4's (for posts)
    - Plywood (for exterior of house)
    - Drywall (for interior of house)

  - Gerald will only purchase:
    - 8 foot long 2x4's
    - 8 foor long 4x4's
    - 4x8 foot sheets of plywood
    - 4x8 sheets of drywall.

  - He needs enough plywood to completely cover the exterior walls of the house.

  - He needs enough drywall to completely cover the interior walls of the house, and the ceiling.

  - He needs enough 2x4's and 4x4's to frame the walls. He would like the numbers of plates, studs, and posts to be returned seperately.

  - The smallest wall he will build is 4 feet in length.

  - The largest wall he will build is 60 feet in length.

  - He would like the program to default the wall length parameters to inches, but have an option to insert feet.

  - He would like to save houses by customer name

  - He would like to recall houses by customer name

# Output

Gerald has a specific output requirement, as he needs to feed this result into another application. He's given us a sample below:

```json
{
    "name": "Holbrook",
    "house": {
        "width": 103,
        "length": 103,
        "outsideWallArea": 39552,
        "insideWallArea": 36864,
        "ceilingArea": 9216
    },
    "materials": {
        "lumber": {
            "2x4": 40,
            "4x4": 4
        },
        "plywood": {
            "4x8": 9
        },
        "drywall": {
            "4x8": 10
        }
    },
    "waste": {
        "lumber": {
            "2x4": 4,
            "4x4": 1
        },
        "plywood": {
            "4x8": 1
        },
        "drywall": {
            "4x8": 1
        }
    },
    "purchase": {
        "lumber": {
            "2x4": 44,
            "4x4": 5
        },
        "plywood": {
            "4x8": 10
        },
        "drywall": {
            "4x8": 11
        }
    }
}
```

In this sample, you can see that Gerald needs the materials required seperate from the waste, and then a third section to total the purchase. There are also three attributes of the house added that can be calculated:
  - outsideWallArea
  - insideWallArea
  - ceilingArea

# Setup Instructions

### *TypeScript Project*

Make sure you have the latest version of node and npm.

```
node -v
v10.19.0
```
and
```
npm -v
6.14.4
```

* To install [npm] please, check this link [npm]

* To install [typescript] please, check this link [typescript]

---

## Running the Application

To **build** the application
```
tsc
```
To **run** the application using node

```
node dist/index.js 
```

Or by :

```
npm run start
```

To **compile & start** the application using npm

```
npm run start:dev
```
* This script will run:
    * `npm run  build:compile`
    * `npm run start`
  
<br/>

--- 

<br/>

### *Automate Linting*

* Run the following commands to setup [ESLint] in your *TypeScript project*.

```
npm install --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```
* Create an .eslintrc file(either by touching command or by adding new file from your vitual studio). And add the following:

```
{
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "es2021": true
    },
    "extends": [
        "eslint:recommended",
        "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
    ],
    "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
    "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaVersion": 12,
        "sourceType": "module"
    },
    "plugins": [
        "@typescript-eslint"
    ],
    "rules": {
    }
}
```
* Create an .eslintignore in order to prevent [ESLint] from linting stuff we don't want it by adding the following:

```
node_modules
dist
```

Adding a lint script in your project **package.json** by writing 

**_for further information about the installation and adding plugins please click [ESLint]_**

## Running the Application


To **build** the application
```
tsc
```
To **run** the application and only compile (without running [ESLint] ) 

```
npm run start notest
```
or

```
npm run start:dev:notest
```
- This script will run:
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run start`



To **build & run** the application using npm and lint

```
npm run start:dev
```

- This script will run:
  - `npm run build:lint`
  - `npm run start`

<br/>

--- 

<br/>

### *Automate Linting*

#### *_Installation and setup_*

* Run the following commands to setup [prettier] in your *TypeScript project*.

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
```

* Then, create an empty config file to let editors and other tooling know you are using Prettier:

```
echo {}> .prettierrc.json
```
adding the following script to new **.prettierrc.json**

```
{
    "tabWidth": 4,
    "bracketSpacing": true
}
```
* Next, create a .prettierignore file and add the following:
```
dist
node_modules
```

* finally update the package.json to let pritter running.
